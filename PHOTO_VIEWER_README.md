# Secure Photo Viewer Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a full-screen photo viewer for your secure gallery app with the following features:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Full-Screen Photo Display** - Photos open in immersive full-screen mode
2. **Single Tap Zoom** - Tap once to zoom to 300%, tap again to return to normal size
3. **Pan Support** - While zoomed in, you can pan around the image
4. **Swipe Navigation** - Swipe left/right to move between photos (when at normal zoom)
5. **Swipe Down to Dismiss** - Swipe down to return to gallery (when at normal zoom)
6. **Return to Original Position** - Gallery remembers and scrolls to the photo you were viewing

### Bug Fix Applied:
- **TransactionTooLargeException Fix**: Modified to pass only gallery identifiers instead of large encrypted photo data through Intent
- **Memory Optimization**: Photos are now loaded from GalleryManager instead of being passed through Intent parcels
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added validation for encrypted data size and better error recovery

### Files Created/Modified:

#### New Files:
1. **SecurePhotoViewerActivity.kt** - Main activity for full-screen photo viewing
2. **SecurePhotoPagerAdapter.kt** - Adapter for ViewPager2 to handle photo swiping
3. **activity_secure_photo_viewer.xml** - Layout for the photo viewer activity
4. **item_photo_view.xml** - Layout for individual photo view using PhotoView

#### Modified Files:
1. **build.gradle.kts** - Added PhotoView and ViewPager2 dependencies
2. **AndroidManifest.xml** - Added SecurePhotoViewerActivity with fullscreen theme
3. **styles.xml** - Added FullscreenTheme for immersive photo viewing
4. **GalleryActivity.kt** - Added click handler to launch photo viewer and return handling

### Dependencies Added:
```kotlin
implementation("com.github.chrisbanes:PhotoView:2.3.0")
implementation("androidx.viewpager2:viewpager2:1.0.0")
```

### How It Works:

1. **Opening Photos**: When you tap a photo thumbnail in the gallery, it launches `SecurePhotoViewerActivity`
2. **Data Loading**: The viewer receives gallery name and position, then loads photos from GalleryManager (avoiding parcel size limits)
3. **Photo Decryption**: Photos are decrypted using the gallery pin and salt
4. **Zoom Controls**: 
   - Single tap toggles between normal (fit screen) and 300% zoom
   - PhotoView handles pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures automatically
5. **Navigation**:
   - Swipe left/right moves between photos (ViewPager2)
   - Swipe down dismisses the viewer and returns to gallery
6. **State Preservation**: When returning to gallery, it scrolls to the photo you were viewing

### Security Features:
- Photos are decrypted in memory only
- Uses the same encryption key derivation as the rest of the app
- Full-screen mode hides system UI for privacy
- No photos are stored unencrypted
- No large data passed through system parcels

### Usage Instructions:
1. **Open Photo**: Tap any photo thumbnail in the gallery
2. **Zoom In**: Single tap anywhere on the photo to zoom to 300%
3. **Pan**: While zoomed in, drag to move around the image
4. **Zoom Out**: Single tap again to return to normal size
5. **Next/Previous**: Swipe left or right to view other photos
6. **Exit**: Swipe down to return to the gallery

### Troubleshooting:
- **Tap to Zoom**: Uses PhotoView's native tap listeners for reliable zoom functionality
- **Swipe Down**: Only works when photo is at normal zoom level (not zoomed in)
- **Debug Logs**: Added logging to help troubleshoot gesture detection issues
- **ViewPager2**: Configured for horizontal-only scrolling to avoid conflict with vertical gestures

### Recent Fixes:
- **Fixed Gesture Conflicts**: Replaced custom gesture detection with PhotoView's built-in listeners
- **Enhanced Zoom Controls**: Added backup tap listeners and proper scale configuration
- **Improved Swipe Detection**: Better handling of swipe-down-to-dismiss gesture
- **Added Debug Logging**: Logs help identify gesture detection issues
- **Custom ViewPager2**: Implemented intelligent gesture routing for proper pan vs swipe behavior
- **Edge Detection**: Pan within zoomed image, swipe to next photo only at image edges
- **Enhanced Touch Handling**: Proper separation of zoom/pan vs navigation gestures

### Advanced Features:
- **Smart Gesture Routing**: When zoomed in, panning is handled by PhotoView until image edge is reached
- **Edge-to-Edge Navigation**: Continue panning at image edge to switch to next/previous photo
- **Improved Swipe Down**: Better gesture detection for closing the viewer
- **Conflict Resolution**: Custom ViewPager2 prevents gesture conflicts between zoom/pan and navigation

### Technical Notes:
- **Memory Efficient**: Only loads photos when needed, doesn't pass large data through Intents
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles corrupted encrypted data gracefully
- **Android Parcel Limit Compliant**: Avoids the 1MB Binder transaction limit
- **Smooth Performance**: Uses ViewPager2 for optimized photo swiping

The implementation maintains the security and encryption features of your existing gallery while providing a smooth, intuitive photo viewing experience that won't crash due to large data transfers.
